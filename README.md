# Data-Science-Projects
UCSD COGS 9 data science project

Using python I analyzed a very large dataset by first wranglings the data to match my needs. 
Then I examined and plotted that data calculated r values for statistical analysis.

From this project  I learned python and many libraries that python has. 
I learned how to manipulate a JSON data file through python code and how to conduct 
  a data science project.
